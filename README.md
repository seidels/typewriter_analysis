# Typewriter analysis

Typewriter is a an experimental technique to acquire lineage
tracing data. Find the publication [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04922-8). This repository contains code written for basic analysis of the edited barcode sequences as well as code to simulate, process and analyze this data using phylogenetic inference software BEAST2. 

1) exploratory analysis: exploring basic features of the editing process: rates/probabilities for trinucleotides/TargetBCs
2) simulations for validation: simulation-based validation of the Bayesian implementation.
