# Analysis with 2 sites for all barcodes

In this analysis, we only include the first two sites for all
targetBCs and test if under this condition the clock rate is the same
for all of them.

We run analyses on 3 different subsamples of the data. The data for
subsample i can be found in
"../../alignments/alignments\_2sites\_1000cells\_13tbcs/alignment\_seed[i].txt".
